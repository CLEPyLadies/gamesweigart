## Cleveland PyLadies code game

In groups, we will:

* Take time to play the games and see how they work.

* One person will get a few minutes to introduce _no more than 5_ bugs to the game.

* The rest of the team will work through the errors and try to squash all of the bugs before time runs out!

* We will check our work with [the online diff tool](http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/diff/) once the game is working again.

Both of these games come from Al Sweigart.

A deep dive on guess.py is available [on his website](http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter3.html).

A deep dive on hangman2.py is available on his website, as well. We suggest starting with [the deep dive on hangman.py first](http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter8.html).

The [entire book that these resources came from](https://nostarch.com/inventwithpython) is available in print (for a reasonable price) or online (for free). Al is great!
