Both of these games come from Al Sweigart.

A deep dive on guess.py is available [on his website](http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter3.html).

A deep dive on hangman2.py is available on his website, as well. We suggest starting with [the deep dive on hangman.py first](http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter8.html).

The [entire book that these resources came from](https://nostarch.com/inventwithpython) is available in print (for a reasonable price) or online (for free). Al is great!
